## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap and Status

We're at the end of our proof-of-concept effort. We've created an Agent SDK, a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), and an ONNX-based model runtime with a simple filesystem optimization agent. This project is not production ready and requires a lot more effort and testing on the hardware side. 
Most of our success and demonstrations prove the architecture functions. You can build intelligent system services on a microkernel in user-space that make use of an abstract layer for hardware acceleration + provide a clean and secure interface for application-tier consumption of agents via IPC.
With that said, most of the code at this stagerelies on mocked implementations of the underlying systems and half-implemented consumers. There's a long way to go!

### Current (Phase 1) ‚úÖ
- [x] Agent SDK foundation
- [x] NPU Hardware Abstraction Layer
- [x] Apple Neural Engine mock support
- [x] Filesystem optimization agent
- [x] ONNX model integration

### Near Term (Phase 2) üöß
- [ ] Redox OS integration
- [ ] Extended NPU support
- [ ] Advanced memory management agent
- [ ] Network optimization agent
- [ ] Performance benchmarking suite

### Future (Phase 3) üìã
- [ ] Multi-device inference coordination
- [ ] Distributed agent orchestration
- [ ] Cloud NPU federation
- [ ] Real-time system adaptation
- [ ] Advanced security and isolation

## üåü Why Nebula?

Agents have taken the world by storm and are automating workflows at a rapid pace. But there's a lot of architectural issues with the way that agents currently work and we've only just begun to see the extent that they can be used to improve our day-to-day lives.

Traditional systems are reactive - they respond to resource demands after problems occur. **Nebula makes systems proactive** by using machine learning to predict, optimize, and adapt system behavior before issues arise. This is the value proposition of intelligent system services and having a secure way to do this is crucial for the next wave of AI adoption.

By leveraging specialized AI hardware (NPUs), Nebula can perform complex optimizations with minimal impact on system resources, creating genuinely intelligent computing environments.

Moreover, as developers begin to push their agents further into a user's system, they need wider and broader access. Ever seen the list of permissions an AI Agent wants for your Google account?
MCP Servers are one approach to solving this problem, but they have issues with performance and security. They also provide a protocol for external applications, but only to adapt your runtime to a model's interface. This approach also mostly benefits the Agent provider -- you build the integration to put the Agent interface in front of yours. Doing things the other way around is currently _impossible_ to do cleanly and securely.

Nebula provides a unified, accelerated runtime for agents _and_ a secure framework for integrating with those agents on RedoxOS via system services in the user space instead.
