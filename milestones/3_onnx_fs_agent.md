### Milestone: File System Agent with ONNX Model Integration

#### Summary:
The recent progress in NebulaOS has been focused on enhancing the File System Agent by replacing the mock-based setup with a fully integrated ONNX model. This advancement significantly improves the agent's ability to predict file access patterns using machine learning.

#### Highlights:
- **ONNX Model Integration:**
  - Achieved seamless ONNX model loading and validation.
  - Allowed switching between ML models and heuristics effortlessly.
  - Improved error handling and logging for model operations.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Consistent and robust feature vector generation.
  - Inclusion of time-based, historical, and directory features.

- **Successful Predictions:**
  - Model provides realistic predictions for file access events.
  - Related file prediction functionality enhanced.

#### Technical Achievements:
- Fixed issues in session field access and input format in ML processing.
- Added checks for model validation and tensor borrowing.
- Enhanced memory management and error propagation.

#### Future Steps:
- Consider implementing model retraining and performance metrics.
- Explore alternative model architectures and batch processing.

This milestone marks a significant step forward, enabling the NebulaOS File System Agent to respond dynamically to file system events with data-driven insights.
